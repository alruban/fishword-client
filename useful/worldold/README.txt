Thank you for purchasing the LuxCore underwater scene from DJ Tutorials CGI! 

Make sure that, before you begin, do the following:
1: Make sure that you are using the latest build of LuxCore that works with your version of Blender. LuxCore official releases don't always support the newest build of Blender so make sure that you are using the mos recnet build here: https://github.com/LuxCoreRender/LuxCore/releases/tag/latest

2: Make sure that the scene is being rendered with CPU first, then change the GPU if you are running into render issues.

3: The image textures on the architecture in the background might show Pink. You might need to go into the materials and unpack the image textures and relink them.
